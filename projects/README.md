# Projects

This directory is the home for my major data science and analytics projects.  
Each project lives in its own folder and includes a dedicated README, notebooks, source code, and supporting materials.

I’m building this portfolio incrementally — adding new projects and expanding existing ones as I continue learning and practicing daily. Some projects will be early-stage, others more polished, and all of them will reflect my growth over time.

As the portfolio evolves, this space will serve as the central hub for the work I’m most proud to share with recruiters, collaborators, and anyone interested in my data science journey.
